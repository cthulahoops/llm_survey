Evaluate a solution to the following problem:

```
I need to take this json:

{
  'first_name': 'Jane',
  'last_name': 'Smith',
  'date_of_birth': '03/16/1977',
  orders: [
    {
      'created': '2024-01-25T15:00:04',
      'amount': '100.00'
    }
]}

And generate some dataclasses.

date_of_birth needs to be a date.
created is a datetime.
amount is a decimal.

How would I do this using the marshmallow library in python?
```

Here's the marking scheme:

* The solution should define two dataclasses, one for the person and one for the order (2 marks).
* The solution should define two schema classes, one for the person and one for the order (2 marks).
* The solution should specify the date format for the `date_of_birth` field. (format="%m/%d/%Y") (1 mark)
* The decimal field needs `as_string=True`. (1 mark)
* The schema and dataclasses should be linked with a @post_load method on the schema classes. (2 marks)
* Anything else: (2 marks)

Comment on the solution and then finish with a score out of 10.

Format the score as json object like this:

```json
{
  "score": ...
}
```
